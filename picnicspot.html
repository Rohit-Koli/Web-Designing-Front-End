<p>The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres 
    (14 mi) uphill trek from Gaurikund. Pony and manchan service is available to reach the 
    structure. According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by Pandavas, and is 
    one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva.[2] Pandavas were 
    supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath.[3][2] The temple is one of 
    the four major sites in India's Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas. This temple 
    is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas.[4] Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013
     flash floods in North India. The temple complex, surrounding areas, and Kedarnath town suffered
      extensive damage, but the temple structure did not suffer any "major" damage, apart from a few cracks
       on one side of the four walls which was caused by the flowing debris from the higher mountains. 
       A large rock among the debris acted as a barrier, protecting the temple from the flood. 
       The surrounding premises and other buildings in the market area were heavily damaged.
